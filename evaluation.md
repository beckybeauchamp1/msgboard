## Project Feedback:

Technical Requirements: **Preforming**

>Great job implementing a three model CRUD application and using nested resources and devise!

Creativity/Interface: **Preforming**

>Although you might not have added extensive CSS, I actually really love your styling and interface decisions! Personally, I love and prefer the minimal look :)

Code Quality: **Preforming**

>I think you did a great job using private methods, devise, and form helpers. I would refer to some of my inline comments for further suggestions

Deployment and Functionality: **Preforming**

>Your application definitely is functional and I did not find any bugs in the deployed version. Great job!

Planning Process/Submission: **Progressing**

>While I see you have included a Planning directory, I still don't see your wireframes or ERD. It's not a big deal for this type of project but it's really important especially for employers, they love to see planning evidence!

| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Technical Requirements          | 0 Models, or partial CRUD on at least 1 model. | At least 1 model incorporates `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` routes, but no associations. | The app contains 2 models, with at least 1 association. At least 1 model is full CRUD. | Includes many well-structured models, and advanced functionality such as authorization, 3rd-party API integration, or other technology not covered in class |
| Creativity and Interface        | Zero or Minimal custom styles or interface. Evidence of scaffolded code | The app is styled and has an interface of value to the end user: it is not just a nav bar and an index page | The app displays a personal spin or creative element through its written language, functionality, purpose, and/or CSS. Submission includes proof of HTML / CSS validation | The app is fully responsive, incorporates outside technologies such as Flexbox.  App incorporates modern UI themes, and adds unique  flair. |
| Code Quality                    | Minimal functional code is present       | Code lacks proper formatting, includes commented out, non-functional code, or otherwise contains major issues of quality (DRY, naming, etc) | Code is well-formatted, well-named, and contains few style / quality issues | No major code quality issues, makes use of Ruby best practices appropriately, and follows techniques such as separation of concerns, abstraction, and encapsulation |
| Deployment and Functionality    | Application is not deployed, and contains minimal functionality | Application contains minimal functionality, but deployment is non-functional, or application contains major errors when used | Application contains no major errors, is deployed correctly, and contains a custom Heroku app name appropriate for the app. | App has advanced functionality that works with minimal errors, and may make use of advanced tools such as APIs, plugins, etc. App may be deployed to a service other than Heroku (e.g. Digital Ocean). |
| Planning / Process / Submission | No submission received, or submission does not contain basic documentation of planning (ERD, wireframes, commit history, etc) | App is submitted, with basic evidence of planning. Documentation exists, but lacks common areas such as setup instructions, description of application functionality and link to deployed application | Submission contains clear evidence of planning, adequate documentation, include all from previous category, as well as additional information such as unsolved issues. | Submission includes everything in previous category, as well as evidence of  planning tools, such as Trello, and, incorporates workflows such as feature branching, code review, github issue / user story tracking, and justification of technical decisions. |
